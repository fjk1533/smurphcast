## Overview

Welcome to SmurphCast! This project focuses on percentage-first time-series forecasting, specifically targeting metrics like churn, click-through rate (CTR), conversion, and retention. With a blend of additive models, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and ES-RNN stacking, SmurphCast automates model selection to provide accurate predictions. It is entirely written in Python, optimized for CPU usage, and offers explainable results.

## Installation

To get started with SmurphCast, you need to clone the repository and install the required packages. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fjk1533/smurphcast.git
   cd smurphcast
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:

   You can use pip to install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Using SmurphCast is straightforward. After installation, you can start forecasting your metrics by following these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your data is in the correct format. It should be a time-series dataset with a date column and a target variable (e.g., churn rate).

2. **Load the Library**:

   ```python
   from smurphcast import SmurphCast
   ```

3. **Initialize the Model**:

   ```python
   model = SmurphCast()
   ```

4. **Fit the Model**:

   ```python
   model.fit(data)
   ```

5. **Make Predictions**:

   ```python
   predictions = model.predict(future_data)
   ```

6. **Evaluate Results**: Analyze the predictions and evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE or MAE.

## Examples

Here are some examples to illustrate how to use SmurphCast effectively.

### Example 1: Churn Prediction

```python
import pandas as pd
from smurphcast import SmurphCast

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv('churn_data.csv')

# Initialize the model
model = SmurphCast()

# Fit the model
model.fit(data)

# Make predictions
future_data = pd.DataFrame({'date': pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', periods=30)})
predictions = model.predict(future_data)

# Print predictions
print(predictions)
```

### Example 2: Click-Through Rate Forecasting

```python
import pandas as pd
from smurphcast import SmurphCast

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv('ctr_data.csv')

# Initialize the model
model = SmurphCast()

# Fit the model
model.fit(data)

# Make predictions
future_data = pd.DataFrame({'date': pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', periods=30)})
predictions = model.predict(future_data)

# Print predictions
print(predictions)
```
